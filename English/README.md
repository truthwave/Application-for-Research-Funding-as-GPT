## Why You Need It

Brilliant research gets buried simply because of how the proposal is written.
Grant Proposal Writing GPT changes that reality.

Transforming researchers' passion into—
clear, compelling proposals.

---

## 💬 What It Does
- Automatically generates proposals tailored to Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research
- Clearly organizes “Research Objectives,” “Research Plan,” and “Social Significance”
- Converts text into language reviewers understand
- Handles specialized terminology naturally

---

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Enter your theme, keywords, and societal challenge<br>
2. GPT generates a draft in seconds<br>
3. You can “Focus on your research”

---

## 💻 That's all there is to it

### Step 1: Input your information

```
Research Theme: New semiconductor design utilizing AI  
Keywords: Low power consumption, Deep learning, Design automation  
Social Issue: Energy conservation and environmental impact reduction  
Goal: Establish a semiconductor design methodology reducing power consumption by 30% compared to conventional methods
```

---

### Step 2: GPT rewrites it into “clear language”

> 【Research Objective】
> This research aims to establish a new semiconductor design methodology utilizing AI technology capable of reducing power consumption by 30% compared to conventional methods.
>
> 【Social Significance】
> This research seeks to build a technological foundation contributing to energy conservation and reduced environmental impact. It will enhance the overall energy efficiency of ICT devices and contribute to realizing a carbon-neutral society.

## 🧠 Before → After

**Before**
- Have ideas but struggle to organize them
- Long, hard-to-read documents
- Time consumed by document creation

**After**
- Clearly structured first drafts completed in minutes
- Reader-friendly organization
- Freed-up time redirected to core research
